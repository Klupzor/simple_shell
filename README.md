#  SIMPLE SHELL

0x15. C - Simple Shell: is a project from Holberton School where are to write a simple UNIX command interpreter.
__________

### How to run
 `./hsh`

#### Compilation
It would be compiled this way:
```sh
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh
```
### Testing

The shell should work like this in interactive mode:

```sh
$ ./hsh
($) /bin/ls
hsh main.c shell.c
($)
($) exit
$
```

But also in non-interactive mode:

```sh
$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
$
$ cat test_ls_2
/bin/ls
/bin/ls
$
$ cat test_ls_2 | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
$
```

### Usage

- Includes shell.h
- Run the executable: ./hsh
- Use the command that you need.
- Function returns the output of the command, or error if the command was not found.

### Example Usage
- `Shell start! \*\\(\^-^)/*` = is displayed after run ./hsh
- `\(\^.^)/$ /bin/ls` = display de command ls.
- `\(\^.^)/$ pwd` = display the current directory.
- `\(\^.^)/$ exit` = end with the program  and display a message like:  `Bye! (-_-)zzz`
